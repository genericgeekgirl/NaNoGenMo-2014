genericgeekgirl says, "Magic."
ASchultz says, "Yes, remember the first time we tried sleepmask. Ryan Veeder's one Apollo 18 game. t's nice to have"
DavidW says, " think it's a wrapper around a terp, if that means anything. have trouble understanding it."

Wade says, "ods David"
DavidW says, "So we'll need to circle the Golden Room, think."
DavidW says, "And perhaps we will want to try shooting the clockwork girl."
DavidW says, " doubt every hazard is a teleporter."
Wade asks, "is GGG still connected? Or just deep in thought or something?"
genericgeekgirl says, "Sorry, was mapping."
Wade says, "ah cool"
DavidW says, "also, remind me how many pages we need to find."
Wade says, "four"
genericgeekgirl says, "t's just the nine rooms, centered around the golden room, which we can only safely enter twice. The clockwork girl does not follow us into the bedroom, eastern way, contrition corner or golden room."

Dave has had his fill of playing for now, and goes back to the ounge.

Zach says, "So he doesn't miss the beginning of a new game. 'm not sure if he would mind or not."

Johnny says, "The fox likes deer."
Johnny says, "But, we didn't like the fish when were were all space-ottery, so who knows."
DavidW asks, "sure, but the lure for the deer is the aromatic plant which is on the east side of the river, and surely the beavers will block us as they did the original fox?"

DavidW says, "So maybe we *do* ride the deer."

jenrexrode arrives, full of fun and funk.

DavidW says, "otter"
jenrexrode asks, "how'd we turn into a fox?"
DavidW says, "We lured the fox to the overhang to the north. We both fell into a watery pit. The otter could swim; the fox could not."
DavidW says, "We escaped the pit by using an underground stream to the lake."
jenrexrode says, "ok, i get it"
jenrexrode asks, "so is there anybody else to take over?"
jenrexrode asks, "i mean any other animal?"
DavidW says, "yeah, don't even know what to try next."
DavidW says, " think we have to be the lemur next. The deer is the only other viable choice, unless we want to be a rabbit again."
jenrexrode says, "i guess it depends on which one is most lemur compatible"
DavidW says, "The beaver, fish, crayfish, birds -- none of them seem to count towards reincarnation tricks."
DavidW says, "But don't know what to try vs the lemur. t doesn't have a lure the way the deer and otter seemed to have. And it hides inside thorny bushes as well, making it difficult to reach."
jenrexrode says, "maybe if we were a rabbit, it would want to stroke our ears"
DavidW says, "t didn't before."
jenrexrode says, "heh, let me read up on lemurs"

DavidW says, "oh, sorry. Thought we were at the Spring still."
DavidW says (to Zach), "ot really. We _think_ we need to become the lemur next, except we're not to kill the lemur this time. That seems to imply wounding or poisoning the lemur somehow instead."

DavidW asks, "um, suppose -- and this sounds crazy -- but perhaps we're to become a rabbit again, and as the rabbit, lure the deer -- and maybe the *deer* attack the lemur?"
DavidW says, "With the beavers dead, the rabbit should be able to lure the deer across the river, think."
jenrexrode says, "ah"
DavidW says, "so, if this new theory is right, we kill a wabbit."
